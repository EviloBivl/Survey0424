# Survey0424
An App designed for iPads, to create a simple survey which acts as a mood meter. Results can then be exported via multiple channels in csv format.

## Purpose
The App was a quick solution to provide a mood meter for an exhibition. Since it is designed that the iPad is freely accessible, the survey screen no longer be exited once started. Only a restart of the app let you reach the settings for export again. 
Alongside with Guided Access from the iPhone that was sufficient for the client.
